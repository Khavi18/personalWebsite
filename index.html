            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>In my spare time, I like to work on some projects to learn new skills. Even though I'm a professional iOS Developer, I still believe there's a lot more I can learn in the field. I'm also learning Web Development to broaden my skills. You may look at my github to look at the projects I'm working on currently.</p>

            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <h4>Coding</h4>
            <p>I'm a self-taught programmer and I'm constantly learning and improving my skills in programming (and trying to beat that imposter syndrome).</p>
            <h4>Puzzles</h4>
            <p>Since sitting in front of the computer for long periods of time is frowned upon lol, I also like to complete puzzles in my free time. Whether it's a jigsaw puzzle or a wooden 3d puzzle, I enjoy it all.</p>
            <h4>Badminton</h4>
            <p>A programmer lifestyle can be quite unhealthly, especially due to the limited amount of movement and sitting for hours on end. Which is why I enjoy playing badminton in my free time.</p>
